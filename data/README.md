# Data

This folder contains all files of results or their processing, organized in the following subfolders:

+ `data/raw`: Raw data files. These should not be protected against any change after the first storage.
+ `data/out`: Files generated by processing the raw data and these are the ones used in the analysis (it can be a copy of the raw data if they were already ready to use). The processed data should be composed of both date of generation and descriptive name.
